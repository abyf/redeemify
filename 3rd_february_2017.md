To gain deeper comprehension of development process I strongly suggest to
master Ruby on Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl.
It's one of the best free sources.
As a result you'll build an application that can be a basis for your own
project. You can rework it on your own or we can do it together.
I also plan to start reading it second time.   ok, together it's better
coz I've started and stoped at chap 2, since then I've lost track, whereas together is 
much more better
It's a good idea to start it again together, and work in a pace one chapter per week. Yessss

I have concerns about redeemify.
It's not well elaborated on my mind.
I plan to raise this question in the channel.

There are a lot of local tasks, but the big picture not developed very well.

I think it will be much better to work together by Michael Hartl's tutorial.

For now, we can discuss some aspects of redeemify.

First of all, let's pull latest updates.
cd redeemify
git pull upstream master

Freddy, are you busy now?busy ??? no, I have two hours to kill
Good. I haven't so much time today, but we can start and work at least for an hour.  pk
first let's agreed on what we start, redemmify or Rails tutorials or?

From today we will work on tutorial.
I suggest to work on chapters on our own, and once or twice a week coordinate our
efforts, discuss concepts, code and tasks for chapters.
It will be much productive.
It's a necessary condition for learning to do tasks manually first.
Are you agree? yes
Good! Today we can have a free discussion.
It can be redeemify or something else. Yessss
ok, starting next week, we coordinate chapter one of Rails
Yes

Work on redeemify also has benefits.   Sure
today let's just see some aspects of redeemify, let's proceed from where we stoped

Ok. Let's start with updates
cd redeemify
git pull upstream master  done

Now we have lastes version of the app.
It's always useful to explore the issues and pull requests on GutHub.

As we work in Agile process, first attempts are mostly non-optimal.
Open the project page on GitHub t
https://github.com/strawberrycanyon/redeemify
Scroll down until the beginning of README.md
Look at the badges where? do I have to click on Read me to see it?
CodeClimate found 68 issues

Scroll down until coloured badges   yes, seennnn
Click on one of them
You'll be redirected to CodeClimate page
Click on Issues tab
There is a list of points for improvement.
There are a lot of duplications in code.
It is the potential tasks.
Code should be refactored.

It's a good starting point to eliminate one of the issues.
CodeClimate is a very useful service.
For example, first issue.
Similar code found in 3 other locations (mass = 39)
Found in app/admin/providers.rb and 3 other locations

All the data to start working.
Not necessary to wait until project manager define a task.
You see the bag. You can solve it and propose your changes making
pull request.

When I cliked on the issues tab, this is where I am
https://codeclimate.com/github/strawberrycanyon/redeemify
Yes. Click on Issues tab yes

CodeClimate splits issues on categories. So, it's that thing which is called codeClimate?
Yes. It checks for bugs and points for improvements.
Check the categories on the right sidebar

The overall goal is to make small improvement to learn the collaboration process.
You have to pull latest updates (done)
Inspect the existing issues
Pick one you want to solve
Create a new branch
Solve the task
Create an issue on GitHub with description of the task/bug
Make a pull request with your changes  

It's worth it to master this process  I see
now, code Climate popped a lot of errors 

Yes. 68 issues
Most of them in categories Duplication and Bug Risk yes
ok, I've 

I think if you want to continue work on redeemify, you have to start
with easiest task for you, with the concept that you understand best.
I've started with refactoring of views.  Refactotinf is easy? than the others?
Refactoring is a complex task.
Refactoring of views mostly means moving duplicated code in partials.

What is the easiest task according to you that we can try for now? just to see how it functions

Let me think and observe the code   ok, If I see how to it once, I might continue from time to time on my own

I see we have conflicts to solve
(master|MERGING)
Can you solve them? it means that we have to update smth, if my mind serves me well
Yes. When you pulled latest updates, some conflicts was raised
ah, Isee. git commit to complete the merge
Do you see any files in terminal where we have solve the conflicts?
